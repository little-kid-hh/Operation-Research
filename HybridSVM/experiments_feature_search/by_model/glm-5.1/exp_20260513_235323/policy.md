# Feature Search Policy

Objective:
Improve the linear SVM baseline by adding a small number of interpretable,
per-dispatch numeric features.

Hard constraints:
- Do not change the train/test split.
- Do not change the model family: keep the stage-1 model as linear SVM.
- Do not use labels or any target-derived statistics inside feature generation.
- Do not read files or call external services in candidate feature code.
- Return one row per dispatch and keep feature names ASCII.

Preferred feature families:
- item-level quantiles / tails rather than only mean/std
- thresholded local bottleneck counts, not only global averages
- slack / spare-capacity interactions with large-piece pressure
- repeated-type structure and concentration
- extreme-piece bottlenecks against vehicle dimensions
- face-area / edge-pressure style packing stress signals
- heterogeneity / multimodality / long-tail measures
- features that are easy to explain to a human reviewer

Avoid:
- duplicating obvious existing aggregates unless the new version captures a
  different shape signal
- opaque embeddings
- huge feature sets; prefer a compact hypothesis with clear semantics

Tree-inspired search bias:
- assume trees are winning partly because they exploit local thresholds and
  interactions on features like `spare_capacity`, `wl_to_vehicle_wl_max`,
  `wl_to_vehicle_wl_total`, `sku_average_volume`, and dimension variances
- try to convert those nonlinear effects into explicit numeric features that
  a linear SVM can use

## Iteration 2
- Focus on slack-pressure interactions: the two strongest SVM features (spare_capacity +13.6, sku_counts -10.6) suggest a nonlinear interaction when both are in adverse regimes simultaneously.
- Add a thresholded near-limit count share for the long dimension, complementing the existing p90 quantile with a hard-threshold perspective.
- Add volume heterogeneity (CV) to capture the diversity vs. repetition axis that trees exploit but the linear SVM cannot without an explicit feature.
- These three features are compact, interpretable, and target the three main tree-advantage directions: interaction structure, threshold counts, and distribution shape.

## Iteration 5
- Target the two-dimensional coupling gap: current bank has single-dimension pressure (near_limit_long_share, p90_long) but no feature capturing items large in **both** long and mid dimensions simultaneously.
- Add a spare × p90_long interaction to linearize the nonlinear regime where low slack coincides with extreme long-dimension tail pressure — trees exploit this threshold interaction.
- Add a cube-item share signal: items with dim_s/dim_l > 0.5 resist nesting and create voids, a shape class not covered by thin_item_share or long_wide_item_share.
